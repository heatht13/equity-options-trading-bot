##Strategy:
* When price crosses 9MA upwards, flatten position and go long
* When price crosses 9MA downwards, flatten position and go short
* Biggest downfall is number of trades taken can be very excessive, so fees (if they exist) need to be watched closely and taxes will be deplorable 
##Instruments:
SPY Options about a week or two from expiry
##Notes:
* Need to look into use of EMA over MA and vice versa
* Need to look at incorporating other indicators, especially volume
* Need to look at instruments that are less choppy/hold moves
* Need to look into seeing which expiry minimizes time decay, but ensures moves
##TODO:
* Need to get api keys from webull
* Need to find dependable MD feed cause webull currently doesn't offer it
